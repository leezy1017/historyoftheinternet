The humans value craves and worship above all else the thing we seek out minute by minute 24/7 365 days a year, well an idealist might say the answer is love or maybe happiness. A cynic might say money the power, but I'll tell you what I think after watching my fellow bipeds shamble around the spinning rock, these many years. I say the deepest human impulse the most profound desire and need for communication but right now at this moment communication is changing in the old days the way our culture talked to itself all the stuff we read and watched and listened to was controlled by the bigwigs who ran newspapers. Mr. John Heilemann tell us about a communications uprising that is happening all around us. To bring you this tale I have explored the infinite expanses of the internet from its busiest quadrants to its most barren hunts, I've sculpted behind the scenes in Silicon Valley delving into the doings and meetings of the leaders of a new 
generation of companies like YouTube MySpace and Facebook. The companies that have begun to turn the web into a two-way participatory Democratic medium controlled by no one and shaped by everyone in other words our medium. I have also delved into the history of the web to tell you the story of how the seeds of this remarkable transformation were sown right now we all know how the web has changed the world. This is the story of how the world is changing the web this is Silicon Valley California and these dudes are Chad Hurley Kevin Rose and Jay Adelson now they may look more like Doogie Howser han Che Guevara but these guys are among the leaders of the web 2.0 revolution Rosen a Tolson run Digg social news website. The content of website is chosen by its devoted user community of millions surely meanwhile is the co-founder of one of the planet's most insanely popular websites YouTube. The online video sharing service that was bought by Google in 2006 for a jaw-dropping 1.65 billion dollars now. You might think that like other startup players these guys are in it to get rich and yeah, they are, but they are also on a mission to change the world through web enabled people power.

. I think it's just this is what the Internet's all about the Internet's about connecting individuals to information. Who do you trust more? do you trust some corporate executive in some smoky filled back room. Or do you trust your peers and the people who are connected to you that sounds like fighting talk that is because it is dig and YouTube are part of a new wave of web services. Each more popular than the last all of which offer an alternative to old-school media like the one you're watching right now until very recently the old television order operated according to a set of ancient and antiquated customs incredibly charismatic, slightly obnoxious guys like me would travel around the world with huge expense accounts. Even bigger salaries getting we filmed by guys like these for the average person the TV industry was impossible to get into it was a clubby system. Decided on its own, what would get on the air them too in other words but not anymore today the TV industry is being blown wide open made accessible to everyone all because of YouTube and a transformation summed up by its two-word slogan broadcast yourself before it was just a traditional media companies that would control the gates of distribution and also they were controlling what was being produced but we think everyone has an occasion or should have the ability to be heard it's not surprising that some of the titans of television find YouTube so threatening especially.

After its marriage to Google ,what Chad Hurley and his gang have done is given us all a power they used to reside only in the hands of the Masters of big media they've given each and every one of us. Our own personal broadcast tower from which we can transmit our home video creations be they brilliant or utterly moronic to a potential audience of millions over a dig a similar kind of  experiment is underway only here the subject isn't frivolous, TV entertainment but that most self-serious of subjects news like a newspaper dig is full of the latest goings-on from around the world. What lands on digs front-page isn't decided by some stripe be sure to ink stain then Bradley wannabe it's decided by you, the user the more people who dig which is to say vote for a given story more prominence gets on the site you know it's always been a handful of editors that determine what belongs.
