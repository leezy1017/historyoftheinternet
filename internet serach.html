Imagine a world without Google, now seriously a world without Google a world where you could not do detailed reconnaissance on your blind date for tomorrow night. A world where you could not find out with the click of a mouse it's the GDP of Kazakhstan. A world where if you're not feeling well you can't just sit down at your computer and figure out whether it just pop a couple aspirin or do you need to call 911 one it's amazing right just 10 years ago. There was no Google in five years before that there was no way at all to search the Internet and that posed a big problem because really what used was the World Wide Web if you couldn't navigate it and get where you want it to go the companies that took a stab at search included some of the most iconic names in the history of the neck. Like the Yahoo site but even though the guys who started those outfits were some of the brightest young things in the annals of American business in the end they found themselves unable to crack the code then a pair of super brainy, super nerdy 20-somethings solved the search problem. I am going to tell you how they did it and how they became multimillionaires in the process. I have covered the search revolution from the start the story. I'm here to tell you is about the high-tech innovations that underpin that revolution and about the enormous economic upheaval that it unleashed it's an exciting tale full of fierce ambition and ingenuity full of opportunity seized an opportunities missed with secret maneuvers and meetings that never come to light until now. 
On the web today you type my name John Holliman into a search engine and food and a third of a second you can find out instantly that I'm a magazine journalist and peruse a catalogue of pretty much everything. I've ever written given that there are over a hundred and fifty million websites and billions of web pages out there the technology that makes a super accurate search possible is kind of a miracle and it's a miracle that most of us have come to take entirely for granted. We forget that a little more than 10 years ago this is what the web looked like page after page of plain text long lists of underlined sentences finding what you were looking for on the web was damn near impossible.
 There was no way to search for anything all you could do is follow links and hope that luck would land you somewhere useful to understand how we have come so far.</p>
<p align="justify"> How the web search miracle happened, we must go back to the time before Google to the story of the companies like Yahoo and excite that paved the way for its existence. Its fiercest rivals and to a little place in California that you may have heard something about Silicon Valley California. This 30-mile stretch is the place to be for people with a knack for inventing the future and an appetite we are getting enormous rich in the process. it is the home of legendary tech names like Apple and Intel and Oracle a part of Silicon Valley, the real wellspring of the high-tech industry. The source of countless great ideas is not any company, it is Stanford University and it is here at Stanford where the roots of search can be found. We are interested in a couple of slackers named Jerry Yang and David filer who were left to their own devices. When the professor went on a year-long sabbatical now if you are trying to impress upon your kids the importance of being 
diligent about their studies always doing their homework this is not a particularly good story to tell them because while Jerry and David we are goofing around they hit on an idea that will become the basis for one of America's best-known businesses and turn them into billionaires today their company is called Yahoo and it's among the most traffic sites on the web all began when Jerry and David were trying to find a sneaky way to use the Internet to win a Stanford fantasy basketball league boys were electrical engineering students and they had access to the web they scoured a laborious Lee site bysite looking for up-to-date sports information David figure out how to go to all these different places to get all the data from the previous night's basketball games pulled it all in and crunch data and try to figure out what you know we should change players or trade players or do whatever it's hard to imagine more Trivial Pursuit that fantasy basketball but in hunting around for obscure sports data on this weird clunky Network called the Internet Jerry. </p>
