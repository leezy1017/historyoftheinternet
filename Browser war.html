The John Holliman tells the story of web's rise from obscurity to global ubiquity, it's a tale like the back of hand because as a journalist I had a ringside seat for the whole shebang for more than a decade. Author was right here in Silicon Valley witnessing up-close moments that shaped the Internet age, the era began with a vicious power struggle to decide who would control the future of the just emerging web. The Jim Clark starts literally pounding the table and he is like, we have to take this thing public better take a public right now close of trading. The author had made 663 million, a struggle that would end with an epic courtroom battle. We were like a deer in the headlights with Microsoft in front of us, so you know what to do. Author did it was all hands-on deck, this is not a drill they are going to crush us looking across us. The undergraduate computer nerds from the University of Illinois, lived in a strange new unexplored space a place called cyberspace back in 1993. These guys were fascinated by the obscure scientific research network called the World Wide Web invented in 1989 by an English scientist called Tim Berners-Lee, having grown up with this kind of technology at her fingertips. Mr. Bill Gates was the co-founder and CEO of Microsoft, the most important and fantastically profitable high-tech company of them all. Two decades Microsoft had established anear monopoly over PC operating systems and it used that monopoly to gain a vice-like grip over the entire computer industry. The web with cyberspace as a wide-open road fast-moving and exhilarating and it would take you anywhere that your curiosity led you the Bill Gates thought that the information highway should be a toll road. On which Microsoft controlled all the toll booths. We would all have to pay to drive thanks a lot Gates's online system was called surprise the Microsoft Network and in 1994 lots of smart people assumed that he would succeed in foisting down the world, like he usually did here was the information superhighway the futurist had been predicting for years and although Gates didn't realize it yet. His worst nightmare was about to come true a gang of kids is young and ambitious as he himself and once men were about to threaten everything he stood for and everything that Microsoft had achieved brilliant,
 the spectacle that obsessed with computer since his boyhood Bill Gates's journey to becoming the most powerful figure in technology began in 1975.

At the age of 19 he dropped out of Harvard start Microsoft with his high school pal. Paul Allen Cates his vision was simple and wildly ambitious a PC on every desktop in every home in every office and every one of those pcs running Microsoft software by 1993 his dream was tantalizingly close to becoming reality about 90% of the world's pcs were running Microsoft Windows this spectacular success had turned Microsoft into a veritable money machine raking in billions of dollars in profits and turning thousands of Microsoft employees into stock option millionairesâ€™ gates in the army that he'd amassed on Microsoft's sprawling campus in suburban Seattle, worked insanely hard and they played very rough with their rivals. The company's rise had left a trail of corpses in, its wake there was Lotus there was WordPerfect there was Borland. There was Novell even mighty IBM all brought to their knees Gates was now one of the richest and most influential men on earth and he knew it one night at a dinner party he and some friends were discussing the election of Bill Clinton as president and gates blurted out. I have as much power as the President does his wife kicked him under the table when she heard that the truth of it was, he might have been right too many gates his power was seductive irresistible. If you were a young hungry software engineer like Thomas rear or a seasoned executive like Microsoft was the place where it did not matter. If you were handsome or athletic place were smartness measured by the ability to crank out killer code was the only thing that counted in other words. Nerd nirvana in the early 90s Microsoft campus is a very dynamic culture you'd have many of the smartest people in computer science at all different ages, but it was a surprisingly young company. Overall, the average age of 
the company was probably 26 27 Microsoft was not the biggest software company but in a weird way it was the hottest.
