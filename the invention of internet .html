The Internet is the essential technology of time and the historic upheaval in system communications for human. The internet empowers millions of people through private (personal) computers to interconnect via email among the global. This is the era of the Internet and a global system of computer-based communication. At the turn of the 21st century millions of people around the world are now online every day to exchange messages conduct business meet people and find information regarding to their concerns. The communication can also be a tool of war to manage material and manpower as the UN coalition did in the war against Saddam Hussein. We have learned that lesson clearly in the 1992 Gulf War. The America gave birth to a space program that grew from a call to a run by presidential edict computer communication, It was in the embryonic stage but it was making progress at MIT.
 A graduate student named “Leonard Kleinrock” began applying queueing theory to data transmission. </p>
 
<p align="justify">
The Keowee theory is a fantastic tool for evaluating computer and communication systems. It is a very simple structure, it's simply a system to which one arrive hang around a while and leave like letters going through post offices as Kleinrock showed.  The packages of data would queue or line 
up at the nodes of a communications network as they transit it through this way, he could determine the overall speed of the network. Besides leveling American cities, the telephone system would be so damaged that the military would be unable to launch a counterattack to assure retaliation. America needed an indestructible communications network. The Paul Baran was hired to see if one could be built, they started off by playing with fishnet type networks so that if one chop it up there is still a path through the network. Now the problem was we didn't know how to do that, so came up with the notion of what we call the hot potato routing, sort of a demonstration as it's doable so the traffic could find its way through the network. But to do that had to chop the data up in little pieces hot potato routing meant a message transiting a network got to where it was going 
even if part of the network was destroyed.

An ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) needed a separate terminal to log into each of several time-shared computers at research centers across the country no two computers could talk to each other so Taylor had to move from terminal to terminal to work on a different computer. He knew a single terminal could suffice if all the computers were in a common Network Taylor wanted to build a network because he thought it was crazy that he had to have three different terminals to talk three different machines instead of one per mole that could talk to all three. So his notion was to pursue the creation of a network which would link heterogeneous computers to each other through this network. Taylor asked his boss for money to build a computer network arguing that it could save ARPA time money and resources. It was a very straightforward connect researchers to expensive computers that would not want to replicate resource-sharing. Taylor recruited Larry Roberts for the job Roberts had built the world's first experimental connection between two computers at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington Massachusetts.
In April 1971 the ARPANET had 18 mainframe computers hooked into the network Bob Metcalfe was a grad student who connected mi t--'s computer to it the thrill was connecting things together. 
The internet grew by the fate and fortune of new technologies among them were breakthroughs in electronics that brought mainframe computer power down to the size and cost of a desktop PC. The silicon chip, a high-speed modem and the computer mouse are as significant in shaping the use of the Internet as the first imp however one of the Internet's major milestones was achieved not by technology but by an act of Congress. On June 9th 1992 Congress passed a bill taking the internet out of the exclusive hands of government and into the public the following November President Bush signed it into law the internet had crossed the Rubicon the government in particular National Science Foundation. Which have been investing in research in the ARPANET and then the internet began to get the idea that maybe this should be turned loops this technology should 
be turned loose into the open world for commercial use.
